We stepped up our efforts to make Zomato an immersive experience for users of both kind - consumers & creators. Our then five member mobile team won the "App of the year" award by NDTV, beating the likes of WhatsApp, TrueCaller and PayTm.

<h5> Major changes in this version included the following-</h5>
* <b>First-use User Experience</b> - With the increased number of features in the app, we made use of On-boarding screens and first runs to simplify UX.
* <b>User uploaded images</b> - Using Android's Camera API and NDK's power, we made our very own in-app image uploading process, image filters and gallery views. We wrote our own thread for displaying the images in a gallery view inside the app keeping the limitations of Async threads in check.
* <b>New Home Page</b> - In a very significant change from the previous version, we split our single home page into a new page with four different tabs.

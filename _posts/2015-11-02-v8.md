Our super fast development cycles and the multi faceted nature of the product gave birth to the ideology of development kits. We rethought the entire product as a complex organism and broke things down to atoms and molecules - and thus multiple development kits were born - UI Kit, Ordering Kit, Network Kit, Image Handling Kit...you get the idea.

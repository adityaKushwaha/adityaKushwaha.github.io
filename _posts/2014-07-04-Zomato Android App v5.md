Users started to create lots of content on Zomato - reviews, photos and ratings. We used this surge of information created by the people to be used in beautiful endless scrolls of food feed to be used by other users. In true crowd-sourced fashion, we created a food guide that went beyond ratings and menus. It captured the moods of the commoners as well as the connoisseurs.

<h5> Major changes in this version included the following- </h5>
* <b>Presenting the Food Feed! </b> - World's first timeline of food updates from around you and your friends. This increased the traction and the average session length of the app.  
* <b>New Home page</b> - We completely redesigned the Home Page with a simple tab on top, re-ordering features on the home page according to their usage, the change was inevitable as we launched multiple new features that needed more face time.
* <b>Presenting Collections </b> - We made a new feature where restaurants were classified as a group on the basis of a common USP, this feture went on to become the most loved feature. Collections differed n each city and later we let the users create their own collections. From London's Fish & Chips places to India's street food, collections are a big hit.
* <b> New Feature | Speed-dial/Bookmarks</b> - This new feature allowed the users to maintain a list of their frequently visited restaurants.
* <b> New Splash & Login flow</b> - We reduced the app launch time, optimized the login screens to increase conversions into registered users.

In the biggest ever move for us, we acquired UrbanSpoon! Our combined userbase grew four times and the number of cities of operation went from 250 to 10,000! 
With time, we transitioned our users, scaled our systems and evolved to play with loads of data. 

<!--more-->
With this huge transition - life as we knew it had changed - Along with our logo, size of our userbase and areas of operation, multiple legacy algorithms and systems started to fail by the sheer scale of our data. We had to rework a lot of our logic to cater to this monumental scale of sessions on the app.

<h5> Major changes in this version also included the following- </h5>
* <b>Certificate Pinning using Deffie Hellman Key Exchange Algiorithm</b> - Pinning is the process of associating a host with their expected X509 certificate or public key. Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman later went on to win the coveted <b>Turin award</b> in 2015!
* <b>Material Design principles</b> were introduced. 
* The store front of our app - The Restaurant Page - was made from scratch to include the product changes from UrbanSpoon.

This version saw a major shift in how we handled our underlying layers: network and transport layer and data! 
We moved from parsing data using XML parsers to the new age GSON parsers, changed our HTTP client to OkHttp3 for an array of improvements.

<!--more-->

### More in this version:
* Moved to Bottom Navigation on the Home page.
* Introduced Table Reservations through the app.
* Integrated our inhouse Data Analysing Engine (Jumbo!) deep into the app.
* Google App Indexing

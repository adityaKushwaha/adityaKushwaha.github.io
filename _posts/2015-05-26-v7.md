In the biggest ever move for us, we acquired UrbanSpoon! Our combined userbase grew four times and the number of cities of operation went from 250 to 10,000! 
With time, we transitioned our users, scaled our systems and evolved to play with loads of data. 

<!--more-->

### More in this version:
* Certificate Pinning using Deffie Hellman, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman later went on to win the Turin award in 2015!
* Material Design Principles were introduced. 
* The store front of our app - The Restaurant Page - was made from scratch to include the product changes from UrbanSpoon.

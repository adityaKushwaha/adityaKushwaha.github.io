Our super fast development cycles and the convoluted nature of our product gave rise to the ideology of development kits. We thought of the entire product as a complex organism and then broke things down to atoms and molecules - and thus multiple development kits were born - we had an UI Kit, Network Kit, Online Ordering Kit, Image Handling kit...you get the idea.

This version saw a major cleanup of our code into functional and robust libraries and development kits - such was the ease of usage of the kits that we even tied up with a Snapdeal, Helpchat and the likes by providing them with our Online Ordering kit.
